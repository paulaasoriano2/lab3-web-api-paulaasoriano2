# Web Engineering 2025-2026 / Lab 3: Complete a Web API

A minimal Spring Boot + Kotlin starter for Lab 3. Complete the tasks in `docs/GUIDE.md` by filling in the SETUP/VERIFY blocks in the tests to demonstrate HTTP method safety and idempotency.

## Tech stack
- Spring Boot 3.5.3
- Kotlin 2.2.10
- Java 21 (toolchain)
- Gradle Wrapper

## Prerequisites
- Java 21
- Git

## Quick start
```bash
./gradlew clean build
./gradlew test
./gradlew bootRun
# Default: http://localhost:8080
```

## Project structure
- `src/main/kotlin/es/unizar/webeng/lab3`: application code (`Application.kt`, `Controller.kt`, `Employee.kt`, `EmployeeRepository.kt`)
- `src/test/kotlin/es/unizar/webeng/lab3`: tests (`ControllerTests.kt`)
- `docs/GUIDE.md`: assignment instructions

## Assignment tasks
See `docs/GUIDE.md` for detailed steps:
- Complete the SETUP/VERIFY blocks for `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` in `ControllerTests`
- Run the test suite and ensure all tests pass

## Code quality and formatting
```bash
./gradlew ktlintFormat ktlintCheck
```

## Testing
```bash
./gradlew test
```

## Bonus opportunities
Be the first to complete **at least two** of the following tasks to earn a bonus:

### 1. **Implement Comprehensive Security with Authentication and Authorization**
- **Description**: Add robust security mechanisms including JWT-based authentication, role-based authorization, and protection for different HTTP methods based on user permissions.
- **Implementation**: Implement JWT token generation/validation, create user roles (ADMIN, USER), secure endpoints that modify data (POST, PUT, DELETE) with proper authorization, and add security tests that verify unauthorized access is properly rejected.
- **Goal**: Demonstrate understanding of API security principles and protect sensitive operations.
- **Benefit**: Shows mastery of modern authentication/authorization patterns and API security best practices.

### 2. **Implement RESTful API Documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger**
- **Description**: Add comprehensive API documentation using SpringDoc OpenAPI, including detailed descriptions of HTTP method semantics, request/response examples, and error scenarios.
- **Implementation**: Document all endpoints with proper HTTP status codes, include examples for safe vs unsafe operations, and add interactive Swagger UI.
- **Goal**: Create professional API documentation that explains the RESTful design principles.
- **Benefit**: Enhances API usability and demonstrates understanding of API design best practices.

### 3. **Add Advanced Error Handling with RFC 7807 Problem Details**
- **Description**: Implement sophisticated error handling using RFC 7807 Problem Details for HTTP APIs, with proper error types for different scenarios.
- **Implementation**: Create custom exception handlers, map different error scenarios to appropriate problem types, and include correlation IDs for debugging.
- **Goal**: Provide consistent, informative error responses that help API consumers understand and handle errors.
- **Benefit**: Shows understanding of modern API error handling standards and improves developer experience.

### 4. **Implement API Versioning and Content Negotiation**
- **Description**: Add API versioning support and content negotiation for different response formats (JSON, XML, etc.).
- **Implementation**: Support multiple API versions, handle different Accept headers, and provide appropriate responses based on client preferences.
- **Goal**: Demonstrate flexibility in API design and support for diverse client needs.
- **Benefit**: Shows understanding of API evolution and client compatibility strategies.

### 5. **Add Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring**
- **Description**: Implement structured logging with correlation IDs, request tracing, and performance metrics for API operations.
- **Implementation**: Add request/response logging, track method execution times, and include correlation IDs for request tracing.
- **Goal**: Enable effective debugging and monitoring of API behavior.
- **Benefit**: Demonstrates understanding of production-ready API observability.

### 6. **Implement Rate Limiting and API Protection**
- **Description**: Add sophisticated rate limiting, API key validation, and DDoS protection mechanisms to safeguard API endpoints from abuse.
- **Implementation**: Implement sliding window rate limiting, API key-based access control, request throttling, and protection against common attacks (brute force, spam).
- **Goal**: Protect the API from abuse, overuse, and malicious attacks.
- **Benefit**: Shows understanding of API protection strategies and production security concerns.

### 7. **Add Integration Tests with Real Database**
- **Description**: Create comprehensive integration tests that use a real database (H2 or PostgreSQL) to test the complete data flow.
- **Implementation**: Test database transactions, verify data persistence, and test concurrent access scenarios.
- **Goal**: Ensure the API works correctly with real data persistence.
- **Benefit**: Demonstrates understanding of integration testing and database interactions.

### 8. **Implement Caching and Performance Optimization**
- **Description**: Add HTTP caching headers, implement response caching for safe operations, and optimize API performance.
- **Implementation**: Add appropriate cache headers for GET requests, implement response caching, and optimize database queries.
- **Goal**: Improve API performance and reduce server load.
- **Benefit**: Shows understanding of web performance optimization and caching strategies.

### 9. **Add API Testing with Contract Testing**
- **Description**: Implement contract testing using tools like Pact or Spring Cloud Contract to ensure API compatibility.
- **Implementation**: Define API contracts, test consumer-provider compatibility, and ensure backward compatibility.
- **Goal**: Ensure API contracts are maintained and consumers are not broken by changes.
- **Benefit**: Demonstrates understanding of API contract management and consumer protection.

### 10. **Replace with Spring WebFlux Reactive Implementation**
- **Description**: Replace the current blocking implementation with [Spring WebFlux](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web-reactive.html) for reactive, non-blocking API operations.
- **Implementation**: Convert controllers to use reactive types (Mono/Flux), implement reactive repositories, and maintain the same API contract while gaining reactive benefits.
- **Goal**: Demonstrate understanding of reactive programming and non-blocking I/O.
- **Benefit**: Shows mastery of modern reactive web development and performance optimization.
